-- A longer description of the package.
Description: Any MVar or other concurrency primitive can be read by or written to any function which recieves it as a value. This package provides read-only and write-only versions of Chan, MVar, TChan, TMVar, and TVar. Functions which use these versions receive permission to read, write, or both based on their type signatures.
